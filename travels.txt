My favorite travel experience was going to NYC
for New Year's Eve for my honeymoon (no longer
married), and we ended up in an empty restaurant
at Times Square when the clock struck midnight, and
we celebrated with the staff. When we saw they were
closing, we insisted on leaving, but when they heard
it was our honeymoon, they insisted we stay. It should
be said that the tip matched their generosity.
